# Polkadot Â·

Polkadot is a super simple, mildly opinionated and lightweight web framework built on [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka).

It supports the **necessities**:
- Static asset server `./src/public/assets/...`
- Web router `./src/public/routes.js`
- View loading `./src/public/views/...`

###### _a perfect match for your vanilla project_

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo wherever you want it
- Run `npm install` from the command line to install the dependencies
- Launch the server by running `npm run start`

> You'll find the application running on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
